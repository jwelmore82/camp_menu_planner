My code Louisville project - Now with PHP!

    Typically, when you go to a recipe site, if you do a search for recipes
the site returns a long list of recipes that may only contain one or two
of your specified ingredients and then a bunch of others.  This can be useful
if you are planning a meal and will have time to shop before you are ready to
prepare the meal.  However, if you are looking for something you can make with
whatever you have on hand, combing through recipes can be exhausting.  That
observation, along with my love for the outdoors, gave me the idea for this site.
    The first version of the site, built for the front-end development course,
simply had all recipes lurking in the background and were shown or hidden using
JavaScript and jQuery.  Truthfully, the idea was probably beyond the scope of
that first project.  Adding PHP and building a database for this newer version
has been an amazing learning experience.  Most of the CSS and some of the HTML
survived, otherwise it's a whole new site: content is spread over multiple pages
and files, recipe and ingredient data are in a database, and the server is now
responsible for the heavy lifting rather than the browser.  Also, there's no
longer the feeling of "Nothing happened..." when no recipes match.
    Most of the code in this project is written using procedural methods rather
than OOP, though I understand the basic concepts (properties, methods,
constructors, etc.) that OOP uses.  Another thing that could use a bit more work
is the testing.  I have included PHPUnit via composer and written some simple
unit tests, but that's about all at this point.
    Something that you may not see (directly) in my code is my level of
confidence when it comes to finding the information I need.  I spent a good
amount of time reading docs and forums while working on this project, and I feel
confident that I can continue to find relevant information in a working
environment.
