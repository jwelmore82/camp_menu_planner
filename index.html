            <img src="img/field_kitchen.gif" alt="Field Kitchen" width="200px" />
            <h4>Prepare your meals</h4>
            <p>Be sure to check your ingredients before you make it to your
                campsite. You may have food on hand you wouldn't normally
                think to take.</p>
            <h4>Do your prep at home</h4>
            <p>Many items, such as chopped onions, can be prepared at home
                 and kept in reusable containers.</p>
            <h4>Hydrate!</h4>
            <p>Camping and outdoor activities in high tempuratures
                can drain you quickly, keep plenty of cold drinking water in
                camp.</p>
            <h4>Aluminum Foil</h4>
            <p>Aluminum foil is extremely useful and versitile for camp cooking.
                Keep some with your camp kitchen items at all times.</p>
            <h4>Spice it up</h4>
            <p>Keep a portable spice set with your camp larder.  These can
                be found in the camping section at many retail stores, or there
                are many DIY ideas to be found online.</p>

            <p>No cooking required (made on the way to the campsite by the kids).

            Place all ingredients into a gallon Ziploc baggie. Squeeze all the air out of the bag and seal. Place this bag inside another gallon Ziploc baggie, squeeze out the air and seal. Make sure each bag is sealed. This is the fun part. At the beginning of your road trip, let each person start squeezing the bag. The squeezing and the warmth of the hands is mixing the fudge. When the first person is tired of squeezing, pass it to the next person.

            When it is all mixed well, flatten the bag and fudge out and drop into a cooler of ice when you get to your campsite or in a small cooler in the car. When it is solid, it is ready to eat.
